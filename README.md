## Notebooks
### data_import_exploration
This notebook contains a walkthrough from the first import of the data, formatting the data,
initial analysis and exploration, and finally storing the data in a desired format.

### logistic
Scikit-Learn example on using logistic regression to classify the data

### dense
Keras example on using a fully-connected neural network to classify the data

### convolutional
Keras example on using a convolutional neural network to classify the data

TODO:
* Add example on model saving
* Go through texts and see if it fits well with the rest of the material
