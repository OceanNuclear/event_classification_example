### data_import_exploration
This notebook contains a walkthrough from the first import of the data, formatting the data,
initial analysis and exploration, and finally storing the data in a desired format.

### logistic
Scikit-Learn example on using logistic regression to classify the data

### dense
Keras example on using a fully-connected neural network to classify the data

### convolutional
Keras example on using a convolutional neural network to classify the data

## /data 
1. CeBr10k_1.txt
 * file with 10000 events
2. CeBr200k_Mix.txt.gz
 * file with 200k events, compressed to comply with githubs max file size for regular repositories.


# TODO:
* Add example on model saving
* Go through texts and see if it fits well with the rest of the material
